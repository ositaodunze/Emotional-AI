# Emotional-AI

Our project is based around the idea of an AI that can detect facial expressions and moods through scanning databases.
Our goal is to have an AI application that can detect a person's facial expression, and therfore mood, and then suggest a song or playlist based on that.
We need to train an AI model on already existing facial recognition databases, Develop a WebCam application for detecting the facial expression of the program user, and Train the AI on recognizing moods through tune, rhythm, amnd lyrics of the song; in order for it to correctly categorize the user's song choice.
